# DenguAI
Predicting the total number of Dengue cases in the cities San Juan and Iquitos based on the given dataset

# Description
Goal is to predict the total_cases label for each (city, year, weekofyear) in the test set. There are two cities, San Juan and Iquitos, with test data for each city spanning 5 and 3 years respectively. 

# Metric of measure - MAE
